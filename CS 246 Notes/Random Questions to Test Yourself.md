- Create the Constructor for a linked list using the above nodes as a template.
- Create the destructor for a linked list
- Create the copy and move constructor for a linked list
- Create the copy assignment and move assignment operator for a linked list

# Static and Spaceship Operator
- Using the spaceship operator, make a program that calculates whether a Linked List is longer than the other.

- Define encapsulation and using structs and classes, make a problem with them.
- Create an iterator to traverse a given linked list. Include the operations `++`, `!=`, and `*`(dereference
	- After, create a main function, given a linked list `a`, using the iterator, output the values of `a` in a
