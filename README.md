# CS 246 Notes
These notes were made by me for the Fall 2023 term. For the UML diagrams, most of them require PlantUML. If you wish to see the compiled UML diagrams, install an extension or program that can render the PlantUML diagrams.
The "Random Questions to Test Yourself" answers may be incorrect. Feel free to PR any mistakes made or any mistakes you may find in my notes.
